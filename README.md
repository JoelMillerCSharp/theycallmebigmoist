- 👋 Hi, I’m @theycallmebigmoist (but you can call me Joel).
- 👀 I’m interested in making video games. I enjoy the process of creating new features from scratch and going through the logic to put my vision for an awesome game mechanic
      into something the player can see and experience themselves!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to take all of my knowledge I gained in my CS degree and putting it into good use by making a video game by myself!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on this new project idea with anyone willing to listen and make their own suggestions and inputs. For now, I'm looking to build my skills
      in the Unity Engine and, thus, primarily program in C#.
- 📫 If you have any questions or you just want to say hi, reach out to my email (jmiller11396@gmail.com) or on my Discord (Joel Miller #3873). Hope to hear from you soon!
